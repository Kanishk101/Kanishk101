Hey,

This is Kan, 16.
You already know the @ so I won't type it here again.

I'm interested in learning multiple coding languages that would help me:
  - Create Applications and Websites, 
  - Manage Databases 
  - And maybe, Cybersecurity as well.

I've been learning HTML, Python an C++ programming languages currently.

I'll just create some Simple Projects and post them on my repository as I keep learning these languages for practice and to keep a track of how much progress I make. 

You can reach me on my Gmail - kanishk.s2015@gmail.com, although ofc, you wouldn't wanna.

Thank You
